The marines begin the game with all buildings built and surrounded by an encroaching force of aliens.&#x0A;&#x0A;How long can they fend off the assault?&#x0A;&#x0A;Both teams begin with all tech unlocked and enough resources to build out their bases. It&apos;s a mad rush for the marines to make one last attack and for the aliens to finish them off before they get a chance to come back!</description>
